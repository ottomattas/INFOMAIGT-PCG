Part 1 - 9.0

Overall I think this is a great idea for the project. You have good sources and
the scope of what you're trying to implement is of sufficient size. Reading your
document does leave me with two questions. First, how will the agents be divided
into phases, and why? Second, you mention you will use a heightmap, but also
that you want to use a low-poly style, and show images from Islanders. These two
approaches don't seem inherently compatible, it would have been nice if you
could have commented on how you plan to combine these two aspects.


Part 2 - 3.0

As you note yourself in your document, the system you ended up submitting does
not generate convincing terrains. One program seems to generate a basic island
shape with some hills, and the other seems to generate some type of fractal
noise which is then thresholded to generate some islands. It is hard for me to
be sure how your system actually works in the end, because you do not describe
it in your document. In the end you seem to have a reasonable starting point for
the basic island shape, but your terrain is severely lacking in features that
make it interesting and/or realistic.
