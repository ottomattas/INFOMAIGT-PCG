I like the first two systems you came up with. The first exhibits good use of
different symbols with different meanings, and the second one nicely uses
randomness to make significantly different structures while retaining the same
overall feel of the objects. The third system is quite simplistic, and mostly
looks the same every time you generate it.

I would have liked to see more elements in your systems that are not just
branching structures, such as using the system to draw the outline of elements
like flowers. I would have also liked the systems to respond better to varying
the number of levels of the evaluation. The dandelion does this quite well,
but the tumbleweed and the rye exhibit some strange behaviour: the tumbleweed
starts to spiral around the space, and the rye gets some incredibly long
straight branches.
